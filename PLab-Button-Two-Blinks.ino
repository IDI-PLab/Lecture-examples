/*
  Button
 
 Blinks a LED connected to digital pin 13 twice when a pushbutton
 attached to pin 2 is pressed
 
 
 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground 
 * pushbutton attached to pin 2 from ground
 * Pullup 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from +5V
 
 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.
